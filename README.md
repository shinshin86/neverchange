## For Users

### Installation

```
npm install neverchange
```

### Supported Browsers

This project currently supports and is tested on `Google Chrome` only.  
We use `Playwright` for our end-to-end (E2E) tests, which are configured to run exclusively on `Chrome`.

All tests are tested only through Playwright.

* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Firefox
* Safari

### Requirements

- Node.js (version 20 or higher recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Usage

#### Dump and Import Features

NeverChangeDB offers two modes for database dump and import: Optimized Mode and SQLite Compatibility Mode.

##### Optimized Mode (Default)

In the optimized mode, the dump output does not include transaction control statements or PRAGMA settings. This mode is designed for:

- Flexibility: Allows for custom transaction control during import.
- Consistency: Ensures the entire import process is wrapped in a single transaction.
- Error Handling: Facilitates easy rollback in case of import errors.
- Performance: Enables fine-tuned control over transaction size and checkpoints for large datasets.
- Platform Independence: Improves compatibility between different SQLite implementations.

##### SQLite Compatibility Mode

This mode generates dump output that closely resembles the standard SQLite `.dump` command, including transaction control statements and PRAGMA settings. Use this mode when:

- Compatibility with standard SQLite tools is required.
- You need to use the dump with other systems expecting standard SQLite dump format.

#### Examples

```typescript
// Dumping a Database
const db = new NeverChangeDB('myDatabase');
await db.init();

// Optimized Mode (default)
const optimizedDump = await db.dumpDatabase();

// SQLite Compatibility Mode
const compatibleDump = await db.dumpDatabase({ compatibilityMode: true });

// Importing a Database
// Optimized Mode (default)
await db.importDump(dumpContent);

// SQLite Compatibility Mode
await db.importDump(dumpContent, { compatibilityMode: true });
```
